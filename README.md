Just a design exercise, aiming to get a hand-solderable board (although a bit challenging) that blinks its LEDs without using a microcontoller. I guess you can call it a mix of digital and analogue electronics, because the main trigger is a binary counter that is fed by a clock generated with an opamp in astable multivibrator config.

## Docs Folder

You can find the [design document](docs/Design%20Justification.ipynb) in the docs section, as a Jupyter notebook.

In the LTSpice folder you will find the circuits used on the Jupyter notebook to guess the current consumption as the battery discharges.

The `docs` folder also contains a couple of Excel spreadsheets I used to calculate some stuff, but they are not that interesting.

## Support Folder

The support folder contains random stuff that I needed at some point, mostly graphics.

I nicked the graphics from [here](https://svgsilh.com/image/2960229.html), which in turn is a variation of [this](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/snowflake-pattern-decor-decorative-2960229/).
