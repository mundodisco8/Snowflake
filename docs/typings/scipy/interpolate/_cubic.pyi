    Parameters
    ----------

        include duplicate values (otherwise f is overspecified)
    y : ndarray
        A 1-D array of real values. ``y``'s length along the interpolation

    If the signs of :math:`d_k` and :math:`d_{k-1}` are different or either of
    them equals zero, then :math:`f'_k = 0`. Otherwise, it is given by the
    weighted harmonic mean

class CubicSpline(CubicHermiteSpline):
    """Cubic spline data interpolator.

    Interpolate data with a piecewise cubic polynomial which is twice
    continuously differentiable [1]_. The result is represented as a `PPoly`
    instance with breakpoints matching the given data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (n,)
        1-D array containing values of the independent variable.
        Values must be real, finite and in strictly increasing order.
    y : array_like
        Array containing values of the dependent variable. It can have
        arbitrary number of dimensions, but the length along ``axis``
        (see below) must match the length of ``x``. Values must be finite.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which `y` is assumed to be varying. Meaning that for
        ``x[i]`` the corresponding values are ``np.take(y, i, axis=axis)``.
        Default is 0.
    bc_type : string or 2-tuple, optional
        Boundary condition type. Two additional equations, given by the
        boundary conditions, are required to determine all coefficients of
        polynomials on each segment [2]_.

        If `bc_type` is a string, then the specified condition will be applied
        at both ends of a spline. Available conditions are:

        * 'not-a-knot' (default): The first and second segment at a curve end
          are the same polynomial. It is a good default when there is no
          information on boundary conditions.
        * 'periodic': The interpolated functions is assumed to be periodic
          of period ``x[-1] - x[0]``. The first and last value of `y` must be
          identical: ``y[0] == y[-1]``. This boundary condition will result in
          ``y'[0] == y'[-1]`` and ``y''[0] == y''[-1]``.
        * 'clamped': The first derivative at curves ends are zero. Assuming
          a 1D `y`, ``bc_type=((1, 0.0), (1, 0.0))`` is the same condition.
        * 'natural': The second derivative at curve ends are zero. Assuming
          a 1D `y`, ``bc_type=((2, 0.0), (2, 0.0))`` is the same condition.

        If `bc_type` is a 2-tuple, the first and the second value will be
        applied at the curve start and end respectively. The tuple values can
        be one of the previously mentioned strings (except 'periodic') or a
        tuple `(order, deriv_values)` allowing to specify arbitrary
        derivatives at curve ends:

        * `order`: the derivative order, 1 or 2.
        * `deriv_value`: array_like containing derivative values, shape must
          be the same as `y`, excluding ``axis`` dimension. For example, if
          `y` is 1-D, then `deriv_value` must be a scalar. If `y` is 3-D with
          the shape (n0, n1, n2) and axis=2, then `deriv_value` must be 2-D
          and have the shape (n0, n1).
    extrapolate : {bool, 'periodic', None}, optional
        If bool, determines whether to extrapolate to out-of-bounds points
        based on first and last intervals, or to return NaNs. If 'periodic',
        periodic extrapolation is used. If None (default), ``extrapolate`` is
        set to 'periodic' for ``bc_type='periodic'`` and to True otherwise.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x : ndarray, shape (n,)
        Breakpoints. The same ``x`` which was passed to the constructor.
    c : ndarray, shape (4, n-1, ...)
        Coefficients of the polynomials on each segment. The trailing
        dimensions match the dimensions of `y`, excluding ``axis``.
        For example, if `y` is 1-d, then ``c[k, i]`` is a coefficient for
        ``(x-x[i])**(3-k)`` on the segment between ``x[i]`` and ``x[i+1]``.
    axis : int
        Interpolation axis. The same axis which was passed to the
        constructor.

    Methods
    -------
    __call__
    derivative

    integrate

    --------

    PchipInterpolator : PCHIP 1-D monotonic cubic interpolator.
    PPoly : Piecewise polynomial in terms of coefficients and breakpoints.

    Notes
    -----
    Parameters `bc_type` and ``extrapolate`` work independently, i.e. the
    former controls only construction of a spline, and the latter only
    evaluation.

    When a boundary condition is 'not-a-knot' and n = 2, it is replaced by
    a condition that the first derivative is equal to the linear interpolant
    slope. When both boundary conditions are 'not-a-knot' and n = 3, the
    solution is sought as a parabola passing through given points.

    When 'not-a-knot' boundary conditions is applied to both ends, the
    resulting spline will be the same as returned by `splrep` (with ``s=0``)
    and `InterpolatedUnivariateSpline`, but these two methods use a
    representation in B-spline basis.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18.0

    Examples
    --------
    In this example the cubic spline is used to interpolate a sampled sinusoid.
    You can see that the spline continuity property holds for the first and
    second derivatives and violates only for the third derivative.

    >>> from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> cs = CubicSpline(x, y)
    >>> xs = np.arange(-0.5, 9.6, 0.1)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6.5, 4))
    >>> ax.plot(x, y, 'o', label='data')
    >>> ax.plot(xs, np.sin(xs), label='true')
    >>> ax.plot(xs, cs(xs), label="S")
    >>> ax.plot(xs, cs(xs, 1), label="S'")
    >>> ax.plot(xs, cs(xs, 2), label="S''")
    >>> ax.plot(xs, cs(xs, 3), label="S'''")
    >>> ax.set_xlim(-0.5, 9.5)
    >>> ax.legend(loc='lower left', ncol=2)
    >>> plt.show()

    In the second example, the unit circle is interpolated with a spline. A
    periodic boundary condition is used. You can see that the first derivative
    values, ds/dx=0, ds/dy=1 at the periodic point (1, 0) are correctly
    computed. Note that a circle cannot be exactly represented by a cubic
    spline. To increase precision, more breakpoints would be required.

    >>> theta = 2 * np.pi * np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
    >>> y = np.c_[np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta)]
    >>> cs = CubicSpline(theta, y, bc_type='periodic')
    >>> print("ds/dx={:.1f} ds/dy={:.1f}".format(cs(0, 1)[0], cs(0, 1)[1]))
    ds/dx=0.0 ds/dy=1.0
    >>> xs = 2 * np.pi * np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6.5, 4))
    >>> ax.plot(y[:, 0], y[:, 1], 'o', label='data')
    >>> ax.plot(np.cos(xs), np.sin(xs), label='true')
    >>> ax.plot(cs(xs)[:, 0], cs(xs)[:, 1], label='spline')
    >>> ax.axes.set_aspect('equal')
    >>> ax.legend(loc='center')
    >>> plt.show()

    The third example is the interpolation of a polynomial y = x**3 on the
    interval 0 <= x<= 1. A cubic spline can represent this function exactly.
    To achieve that we need to specify values and first derivatives at
    endpoints of the interval. Note that y' = 3 * x**2 and thus y'(0) = 0 and
    y'(1) = 3.

    >>> cs = CubicSpline([0, 1], [0, 1], bc_type=((1, 0), (1, 3)))
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1)
    >>> np.allclose(x**3, cs(x))
    True
