# CHANGELOG

## v1.1.0

### Added

### Changed

- Rotated the Battery holder so replacing the battery is a bit easier. It also avoids the battery hitting one of the current limiter resistors and knocking it out
- Changed the decade counter package to SOIC-16. I ordered them by mistake and while they are chunky, the previous one (TSSOP-16) was a source of issues while soldering without magnification (these poor eyes...).
- F.Fab is a tad neater.

## v1.0.0

### Added

- First Release.
